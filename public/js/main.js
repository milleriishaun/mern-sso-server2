  // TODO: FEAR NOT, rapid prototype using Prott and InVision
  // Created Prott low fidelity prototype
  // NOW MAKE THE APP! ... it's just javascript which inclides the jQuery.
  // Also, your .env.example assumes that you are already logged in to the system, and the APIs.
  // The Javascript is thus, just jquery calls. and things like functions to change certain things on the page.
  // This can also be react.
  // jQuery information can be loaded to home pug template.
  // Conclusion: Pug is a templating language, and not really
  // used for React apps. The pug style uses old style programming
  // paradigms. React is a library, but there is a whole
  // framework involved that aims to solve the problems of complexity
  // that arise from using things like Pug. There is however a babel-plugin-for-pug-to-react
  // However, that plugin is only good on surface level.
  // It makes something possible that is not necessarily a good practice.
  // So, then, now I have to scrap this project, but I learned a lot.
  // I will need to move to React, learn it, move into CRA+reactstrap, practice it, then move
  // into react-boilerplate. Then I will have enough understanding to
  // create the app that I intend on making.
